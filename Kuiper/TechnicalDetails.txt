2D Wireframe collider in this project is intended to  work with arbitrary, polygonal shapes.

==========Current methodology==========

Colliding entities check if they have any verticies inside the target.

Primary collision vertex is identified as that which has the furthest distance to the outside
---Outside in this sense is necessarily along the negative velocity of said point. This is something like Separting Axis Theorem, but it is hoped this can handle concavity

Impulse is calculated and applied at this vertex point, if and only if the vertex is actually moving into the surface was calculated to have passed through.

Current performance shows abberant behavior, including very high impulses being registered (possibly as a result of multiple collisions)

==========For future consideration==========

1) It seems like the right thing to do is decompose colliding polygons into convex only polygons.

2) Currently, polygon clipping is resolved after the timestep update, but it seems suggested to find collisions beforehand. Need to consider efficient method for projecting angular rotation at low cost.
